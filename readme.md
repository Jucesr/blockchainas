A very basic implementation of a blockchain using NodeJS. This code was translated from Python code. See [Acknowledgments](##Acknowledgments)

## Getting Started

### Cloning repository

Open your favorite console and get to the location you want to copy this repository. Once there run

For HTTPS
```
git clone https://github.com/Jucesr/blockchainas
```
For SSH
```
git clone git@github.com:Jucesr/blockchainas
```

### Installing dependencies

Go to the folder where you cloned the reposotory and run:

```
npm install
```

### Run the application

In order to start making HTTP requests you will need to start listening in your local machine. Go to the folder where you downloaded the reposotory and run: 

```
npm start
```

If ran succesfully you will see

```
blockchainaz@1.0.0 start C:\path\to\repo
> node index.js

Running on port 5000
```
